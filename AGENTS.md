# Spring Voyage — Project Rules

AI agent orchestration platform — general-purpose, domain-agnostic. Built on .NET 10 and Dapr. Namespace: `Cvoya.Spring.*`.

## Coding conventions

[`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) is mandatory. Read it before writing code.

## Architecture

Architecture lives under [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/README.md); decision records under [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/README.md). Read the relevant doc before working on an issue.

Key concepts:

- **Agents** — Dapr virtual actors with partitioned mailboxes.
- **Units** — composite agents with pluggable orchestration strategies.
- **Connectors** — bridges between external systems and units.
- **Messages** — typed communications between addressable entities.
- **Execution patterns** — _hosted_ (in-process) and _delegated_ (containerised tool execution).
- **Prompt assembly** — four-layer composition: platform, unit context, conversation context, agent instructions.

## Build, test, lint

Use the `/build`, `/test`, and `/lint` skills. Each points at the canonical CI invocation.

Pitfall: bare `dotnet test SpringVoyage.slnx` exits 0 without running tests. Always go through `/test`.

### Before pushing any code-change PR (mandatory)

Run **all three** skills — `/build`, `/lint`, `/test` — at the **solution root**, and fix every failure before pushing. CI runs the same commands on the full solution. A scoped `dotnet test path/to/single.csproj` is **not** a substitute: integration tests live in their own project (`tests/Cvoya.Spring.Integration.Tests`) and routinely break first when API contracts change. Skipping `/lint` because "the change is small" is also not allowed — `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` catches trailing-newline and whitespace errors that block merge.

This applies to dispatched sub-agents the same way: a PR claim of "tests pass" means the full solution-wide `/test`, not a project-scoped subset.

## Documentation updates

When shipping a feature, update the relevant architecture or guide doc in the same PR. A PR that changes user-visible behaviour or architecture without touching the corresponding docs is not complete. New concepts get a doc entry alongside the change.

For changes under `src/Cvoya.Spring.Web/`, keep `src/Cvoya.Spring.Web/DESIGN.md` in sync — it is the portal's visual contract.

## Open-source platform and extensibility

This repository is the **public, open-source core** of Spring Voyage. A private repository extends it via git submodule and dependency injection — adding multi-tenancy, OAuth/SSO, billing, and premium features.

- **Don't bypass `ITenantContext`.** Resolve the current tenant through `ITenantContext.CurrentTenantId`; never hardcode `"default"` or assume only one tenant exists. New persisted entities that should be tenant-scoped must implement `ITenantScopedEntity` so the cloud host can enforce isolation through its scoped overrides.
- **Don't make services static or use singletons outside DI.** Everything must go through the container so the private repo can control lifetime and scoping.
- **Don't create internal types that the private repo would need to access.** If a type is part of the extension contract, make it `public`. Use `internal` only for true implementation details.
- **Don't reference private repo issues, PRs, or branches.** It is fine to acknowledge that a Spring Voyage hosted service exists, but do not link to or create dependencies on `cvoya-com/spring` issues or PRs from this repo. The dependency direction is one-way: the private repo may reference this repo's work, not the reverse.
- **Every design decision must account for extensibility.** The private repo extends, overrides, or composes OSS behaviour cleanly — without forking, patching, or working around limitations. Treat this repo as a framework that consumers use.

### Extension model

- **Tenant-aware overrides.** The OSS core models tenancy through `ITenantContext` and ships a single-tenant default. The cloud host swaps in a scoped implementation. OSS code must not assume a single tenant or hardcode the default tenant id.
- **DI overrides.** The cloud host replaces OSS service registrations with tenant-aware implementations using `TryAdd*`-friendly registration on the OSS side.
- **Plugin contracts.** Implement `IAgentRuntime` (LLM backend + execution tool + credential schema + model catalogue) or `IConnectorType` (external-system binding) and register via DI; the host picks new implementations up without core changes.
- **Cloud API host.** Layers middleware (auth, tenant context) on top of the OSS API host.

### Design principles for extensibility

1. **Interface-first.** Define interfaces in `Cvoya.Spring.Core`, implement in `Cvoya.Spring.Dapr`. Alternative implementations slot in via DI.
2. **`TryAdd*` for DI registrations.** Downstream consumers register their own implementations before calling `AddCvoyaSpring*()`, and OSS registrations don't overwrite them.
3. **Don't seal extensible types.** Services, handlers, strategies, middleware are not `sealed` unless leaf-only.
4. **Composition over inheritance.** Inject collaborators; extend by wrapping or decorating.
5. **No hardcoded single-tenant assumptions.** Use injected services for anything the cloud might scope per tenant.
6. **Virtual hooks on base classes.** Make template methods on `*Base` classes `virtual`.
7. **`Cvoya.Spring.Core` stays dependency-free.** Domain abstractions only — zero NuGet packages.
8. **Extension-point checklist** for new features:
   - Can the cloud swap this implementation via DI? → interface.
   - Can it extend behaviour? → decorator/wrapper or virtual methods.
   - Does it assume a single deployment context? → parameterise via DI.

### What not to do

- **Don't bypass `ITenantContext`.** Resolve the tenant through `ITenantContext.CurrentTenantId`. New persisted entities that should be tenant-scoped implement `ITenantScopedEntity`.
- **Don't make services static or use singletons outside DI.** Everything goes through the container.
- **Don't create internal types that the cloud overlay would need access to.** If a type is part of the extension contract, it is `public`.

### Plugins (agent runtimes and connectors)

Agent runtimes and connectors are first-class plugins. Each ships as its own `Cvoya.Spring.AgentRuntimes.<Name>` or `Cvoya.Spring.Connector.<Name>` project, references only what its contract demands, and registers via a single `AddCvoyaSpring<Kind><Name>()` DI extension. Host-side code references the abstraction only — the registry, install surface, and bootstrap pick up new plugins automatically. Per-project READMEs document each runtime/connector's contract; see also `CONVENTIONS.md` § "Agent Runtimes and Connectors Are Plugins".

## Operator surfaces — relaxation of UI/CLI parity

Operational surfaces (agent-runtime config, connector config, credential health, tenant seeds, skill-bundle bindings) are **CLI-only by design**. The portal MAY expose **read-only** views for visibility, but every mutation goes through the `spring` CLI.

User-facing features remain strictly parity-bound — see [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) § "UI / CLI Feature Parity".

## Agents, Sub-agents, concurrent agents

Multiple coding agents work on this codebase simultaneously.

Rules:

- Every PR must be developed in a dedicated worktree — create one before starting any code work. Never work directly in the main checkout. Other agent processes may be active concurrently and so making changes to the main worktree might result into conflicts or agents tripping on each other's work.
- Small, focused PRs — one issue per PR unless instructed to combine issues into one.
- Rebase onto `main` before merging.
- When adding to shared files (`StateKeys`, DI registrations, enums) — append to the end.
- File follow-up issues before the PR lands and reference concrete numbers in the PR body. Prose-only "we'll file it later" routinely drops follow-ups on the floor.

## Repository Configuration

- `.claude/settings.local.json` is gitignored and is the correct place for user-specific tooling (MCP servers, design tools, personal preferences). Do not add user-specific tool configuration to committed repo files (`settings.json`, agent definitions, or CLAUDE.md). Repo-level config should reflect project requirements shared by all contributors, not individual workflow preferences.
