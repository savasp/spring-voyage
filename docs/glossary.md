# Glossary

Definitions of key terms used throughout the Spring Voyage documentation.

---

**A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**
An open protocol for cross-framework agent communication. Enables Spring agents to collaborate with agents built on other frameworks (Google ADK, LangGraph, etc.).

**Activation**
What causes an agent to wake up and act. Activation triggers include direct messages, pub/sub subscriptions, scheduled reminders, volatile timers, external events (via bindings), workflow steps, and initiative.

**Address**
A globally unique routable identity for any addressable entity. Comes in two forms: path addresses (human-readable, reflecting organizational hierarchy) and direct addresses (UUID-based, stable across moves).

**Agent**
An autonomous AI-powered entity. The fundamental building block of the platform. Can be a worker, observer, advisor, monitor, researcher, or any other role. Every agent has an identity, can receive messages, and can reason about how to respond.

**Agent Actor (AgentActor)**
The Dapr virtual actor implementing an agent. Manages runtime state, AI cognition, pub/sub subscriptions, and the mailbox.

**AgentMemory**
The persistent memory an agent maintains across all threads it participates in. Populated by promotion from **AgentThreadMemory**, gated per-thread by **MemoryPromotionPolicy**. The agent always reads from `AgentMemory` when operating in any thread. See `docs/architecture/thread-model.md` § Q4.

**AgentThreadMemory**
The per-(agent, thread) memory an agent maintains while participating in a specific thread. An agent can only read its own `AgentThreadMemory` for the thread it is currently operating in; it cannot read `AgentThreadMemory` from other threads. Promoted into **AgentMemory** only if the thread's **MemoryPromotionPolicy** allows. See `docs/architecture/thread-model.md` § Q4.

**Boundary**
The interface a unit exposes when acting as a member of a parent unit. Controls what is visible (transparent, translucent, or opaque) and what operations are projected, filtered, or synthesized.

**Clone**
A platform-managed copy of an agent, spawned to handle concurrent work. Governed by the agent's cloning policy (none, ephemeral-no-memory, ephemeral-with-memory, persistent) and attachment mode (detached, attached).

**Cognition Loop**
The five-step reasoning process agents use during initiative: Perceive, Reflect, Decide, Act, Learn.

**Collaboration**
The active shared space where participants converse, coordinate, and get work done. The UX active-workspace surface — what a user opens to do something today. Recorded by the system as a **Thread** and presented in product navigation as an **Engagement**. Example phrasing: "Open collaboration with the writing agent."

**Connector**
A pluggable adapter bridging an external system (GitHub, Slack, Figma, etc.) to a unit. Provides event translation (external events become platform messages) and skills (capabilities agents can use).

**Connector Actor (ConnectorActor)**
The Dapr virtual actor implementing a connector. Manages event translation, outbound skills, and connection lifecycle.

**Conversation**
**Superseded by Thread.** The pre-v0.1 term for what is now a thread. v0.1 leaves a free hand on schema and API change (see `docs/architecture/thread-model.md` § Q10 — no migration, no legacy partition), so there is no `ConversationId` field surviving on disk; the rename is uniform. See **Thread**.

**Conversation Channel**
**Superseded — now described as the per-thread queue inside the agent's mailbox.** See `docs/architecture/messaging.md` (F2 will refresh) and **Thread**.

**Control Channel**
A partition of the agent's mailbox for platform control messages (Cancel, StatusQuery, HealthCheck, PolicyUpdate). Control messages are never blocked behind work.

**Dapr**
A distributed application runtime providing building blocks (actors, pub/sub, state, secrets, workflows) as a sidecar process. The infrastructure foundation of Spring Voyage.

**Delegated Execution**
An execution pattern where the agent actor dispatches work to an isolated execution environment (container) running a tool like Claude Code. The tool drives its own agentic loop.

**Directory**
A registry of agent expertise, queryable within and across units. Each unit maintains its members' expertise profiles. Directories compose recursively through the unit hierarchy.

**Domain Package**
See Package.

**Engagement**
The ongoing shared context between participants over time. The UX product-narrative term for the enduring relationship between participants — used in product navigation, lists, and continuity-of-relationship copy. Recorded by the system as one or more **Threads** (a participant-set change produces a new thread; the engagement absorbs the transition) and worked in as a **Collaboration**. Example phrasing: "Continue this engagement."

**Execution Environment**
An isolated runtime (container) where a delegated agent's work runs. Separate from the agent actor. Sandboxed by default.

**Expertise Profile**
A structured description of what an agent knows and how well it knows it. Seeded from configuration, optionally evolved through observation and learning.

**Human Actor (HumanActor)**
The Dapr virtual actor representing a human participant. Routes notifications and enforces permission levels.

**IAddressable**
The foundational interface: "I have an address." Every entity that participates in the platform implements this.

**IMessageReceiver**
The core messaging interface: "I can receive messages." Extends IAddressable. Implemented by all four actor types.

**Initiative**
An agent's capacity to autonomously decide to act without external triggers. Ranges from Passive (no initiative) to Autonomous (full self-direction). Governed by unit-level policies.

**Mailbox**
An agent's inbound message system, logically partitioned into control, conversation, and observation channels.

**MemoryPromotionPolicy**
Per-thread policy controlling whether an agent's **AgentThreadMemory** for that thread may be promoted into the agent's **AgentMemory**. Default: **disabled** (no promotion). The only memory-flow knob in v0.1. See `docs/architecture/thread-model.md` § Q4.

**Message**
A typed communication between addressable entities. Contains an ID, sender, recipient, type, conversation ID, payload, and timestamp.

**Observation Channel**
A partition of the agent's mailbox for events from subscriptions, timers, and observed agents. Processed in batch by the initiative cognition loop.

**Observer**
An agent that subscribes to another agent's activity stream (with permission).

**Orchestration Strategy**
A pluggable component that determines how a unit routes incoming messages to its members. Five strategies: Rule-based, Workflow, AI-orchestrated, AI+Workflow hybrid, Peer.

**Package**
An installable bundle of domain-specific content: agent templates, unit templates, skills, workflows, connectors, and execution environments. How the platform remains domain-agnostic while supporting specific domains.

**Skill**
A bundle of a prompt fragment (`.md`) and optional tool definitions (`.tools.json`). The smallest unit of reusable domain knowledge.

**Tenant**
An isolated organizational unit. Contains a root unit, users, and resources. Maps to a Dapr namespace. The top-level boundary for access control, billing, and resource isolation.

**Tier 1 (Screening)**
The first tier of the initiative cognition model. A small, locally-hosted LLM performs fast, cheap screening of events to decide whether the agent's primary LLM should be invoked.

**Tier 2 (Reflection)**
The second tier of the initiative cognition model. The agent's primary LLM (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) performs full cognition: perceive, reflect, decide, act, learn. Invoked selectively.

**Thread**
The unique, persistent, system-level record for a set of two or more participants, containing their lifelong shared exchanges and activity. The participant set IS the identity: there is exactly one thread per unique participant set; adding or removing a participant produces a different thread. This is the system / architectural concept — used in code, schema, APIs, and architecture docs. Users do not see threads directly: the product presents the thread as an **Engagement**, and the user works inside it as a **Collaboration**. See `docs/architecture/thread-model.md`.

**Timeline**
The ordered, timestamped record of all artifacts within a thread: messages (user / agent / initiative), task lifecycle events, **ParticipantStateChanged** events, retractions, and system events. Append-only at the platform level; corrections and retractions are new Timeline events that reference prior artifacts, not in-place mutations. Per-thread FIFO is the ordering invariant. See `docs/architecture/thread-model.md` § Q7.

**Topic**
A named pub/sub channel for event distribution. Namespaced by unit.

**Unit**
A group of agents performing together. A unit IS an agent (composite pattern) -- it implements the same interfaces and can contain agents and/or other units recursively.

**Unit Actor (UnitActor)**
The Dapr virtual actor implementing a unit. Manages membership, policies, the expertise directory, and delegates to the orchestration strategy.

**Workflow**
A durable, structured execution plan. Domain workflows run in containers; platform-internal workflows run in the host process.
