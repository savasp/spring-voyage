# Spring Voyage v0.1 — Plan of Record

**Active release frame.** First public release of Spring Voyage. Replaces the scrapped V2 release. V1 was internal-only.

This directory is the canonical narrative for v0.1 planning and execution. Live status (what's in/out, who's doing what) lives in GitHub: milestone `v0.1`, per-area umbrella issues, and `area:*` labels. The files here own the *intent*; GitHub owns the *state*.

## Strategic frame

- V2 release scrapped on 2026-04-25 — bug volume blocked release.
- First public release becomes **v0.1**, intended as the foundation for the hosted service.
- V1 was internal only; the "v2" name is no longer in use.
- v0.1 is foundational, not feature-complete — it establishes the contracts, boundaries, and primary UX (CLI) that subsequent releases evolve.

See [`decisions.md`](decisions.md) for the dated decision log.

## Exit criteria

- [ ] **CLI** — fully functional, well-tested; primary user experience for v0.1.
- [ ] **Public Web API** — surface reviewed, OpenAPI contract documented, frozen for v0.1.
- [ ] **Web Portal** — current portal continues to work on the same public Web API (regression criterion).
- [ ] **New unit/agent UX** — separate UX started for interacting with units/agents (vs current portal's management/configuration/monitoring focus). Scope in v0.1 TBD.
- [ ] **ADR-0029 boundaries** — tenant/platform/UX boundaries documented; component-API surface mapped; agent runtime/orchestrator contracts published.
- [ ] **Conversation concept (#1123)** — implemented (term may be renamed during the area planning session).
- [ ] **Documentation overhaul** — split user/operator vs developer audiences; less verbose, more useful.
- [ ] **Code review + cleanup pass** — discovery of areas needing decomposition; targeted PRs.
- [ ] **All open issues triaged** — milestone-blind sweep.
- [ ] **ADRs re-evaluated** — identify which evolve, retire, or stand.
- [ ] **Stretch:** SV is usable for further development of SV (dogfooding).

## Design lenses (apply to every area)

1. **Web Portal continuity** — every API change must keep the current portal working on the same public Web API. No portal-private API.
2. **Hosted-service foundation** — every architectural decision must be hostable-as-a-service compatible.

## Areas

Each area gets its own planning session, narrative file under `areas/`, and umbrella issue.

                        C2  API target shape + freeze ──►  E1  CLI on top of frozen API
                        E2  new unit/agent UX (design parallel with D/F, build after)
                        B2  doc rewrites (continuous as system settles)
                        G   code-cleanup PRs
```

C and B each have two phases — audit/decision early (parallelisable), freeze/rewrite after architectural settling.

## Workflow

- **Per-area planning session** produces or updates `areas/<x>.md` via PR.
- **`README.md`** updates when areas enter/exit or scope shifts materially.
- **`decisions.md`** appended on strategy-level changes (with dates).
- **Issues** are the unit of execution; **plan docs** are the unit of intent.
- **Triage and execution** flow through GitHub issues + the area's umbrella.

## Conventions

- Stop using "V2" or "V2.1" in any new artefact. Use **v0.1**.
- Don't propose mega-plans for v0.1 — defer detail to per-area planning sessions.
- Apply both design lenses to every area's design.
- Treat existing `CLAUDE.md` (user + repo) and Claude config (`.claude/agents`, skills, plugins, MCPs) as candidates for evolution — see Area A.

## Tracking model

Hybrid:

- **Files (this directory)** own narrative.
- **Milestone `v0.1`** owns release scope (no top-level umbrella — milestone + this README cover that).
- **Per-area umbrella issues** anchor sub-issues + discussion thread per area; bodies are thin (link to `areas/<x>.md` + sub-issue panel).
- **`area:*` labels** filter cross-area issues that don't fit cleanly under one umbrella.
- **Sub-issues + `addBlockedBy`** express real cross-area dependencies.
