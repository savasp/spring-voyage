# Spring Voyage V2 -- User Guide

This guide covers how to use Spring Voyage V2 through the `spring` CLI. It walks through authentication, creating and managing units and agents, sending messages, observing activity, and day-to-day operations.

## Prerequisites

- The `spring` CLI installed (via `dotnet tool install -g spring-cli` or standalone executable)
- For local development: Podman (or Docker) and Dapr CLI installed
- For remote platform: network access to the Spring Voyage API host

## Quick Start

```
# Authenticate (skip for local dev mode)
spring auth login

# Create a unit and an agent inside it
spring unit create my-team
spring agent create my-agent \
    --role engineer \
    --unit my-team \
    --tool claude-code \
    --image ghcr.io/cvoya-com/spring-agent:latest

# Send a message
spring message send agent://my-team/my-agent "Hello, what can you do?"

# Watch the activity feed (no live-stream verb yet — re-run as needed)
spring activity list --source unit:my-team --limit 20
```

> `spring agent create` requires at least one `--unit`. Pick the agent's runtime via `--tool` (`claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini`, `dapr-agent`, `custom`) and supply richer execution config through `--definition-file` when needed; see [Managing Units and Agents](units-and-agents.md) for the full set.

## See it in action

Every workflow in this guide is exercised by a runnable end-to-end scenario under [`tests/e2e/scenarios/`](../../tests/e2e/scenarios/). Each scenario is a self-contained bash script that drives the real `spring` CLI against a running stack, so you can read them as concrete usage examples — or execute them yourself to sanity-check an environment.

- [`tests/e2e/README.md`](../../tests/e2e/README.md) — prerequisites, runner usage, and conventions for the scenarios directory.
- See [Runnable Examples](examples.md) for a curated catalog of individual scenarios grouped by what they demonstrate.
