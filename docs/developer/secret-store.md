# OSS Secret Store: At-Rest Encryption & Per-Tenant Components

The OSS `ISecretStore` implementation (`DaprStateBackedSecretStore`) persists secret plaintext through the Dapr state-management building block. Two layers of defence protect that data on disk:

1. **Application-layer AES-GCM envelope encryption** wraps every value before handing it to Dapr.
2. **Optional per-tenant Dapr component isolation** — each tenant can be routed to its own `statestore-<tenantId>` Dapr component.

Neither layer replaces a proper KMS-backed store in production, but together they make "plaintext in Redis" a non-issue in local dev and reduce the blast radius of a leaked backend snapshot.

## Envelope Encryption (AES-GCM-256)

Every `WriteAsync` call wraps the plaintext in a versioned envelope:

```
[version(1)][nonce(12)][ciphertext(N)][auth tag(16)]   →   base64
```

- **Version 1** is AES-GCM-256 with a random per-write nonce.
- **Associated Data** is `"{tenantId}:{storeKey}"`. A ciphertext cannot be transplanted across tenants or store keys — authentication fails on read.
- **Pre-encryption legacy values** (plain UTF-8 strings with no version prefix) are still readable; they get re-enveloped on the next write.

Platform-scoped secrets use the literal string `"platform"` as the tenant id in the AAD — this matches how platform-owned registry entries identify themselves everywhere else in the system.

### Key Sources

In priority order:

1. **`SPRING_SECRETS_AES_KEY` environment variable** — base64-encoded 32-byte key.
2. **`Secrets:AesKeyFile` config value** — filesystem path to a file whose contents are the base64-encoded key. Useful for container deployments that mount a secret volume.

If neither is satisfied, the service refuses to boot. Earlier versions accepted a `Secrets:AllowEphemeralDevKey=true` fallback that generated a random in-memory key per process; that path was removed because the platform's multi-process topology (spring-api / spring-worker share the same encrypted secret store) means a per-process random key silently corrupted every cross-process secret read. Configure a real key on every deployment, including local dev.

### Startup Self-Check

The encryptor fails fast on obviously weak keys:

- Wrong length (anything other than 32 bytes decoded).
- All zeros or all `0xFF`.
- Sentinel/test patterns (`0x00, 0x01, 0x02, …` ascending; ASCII `"changeme…"`; ASCII `"testtest…"`; all spaces; all `A`).

Error messages name the key source and list both configuration options (env var, key file), so operators don't have to guess.

### Generating a Key

```bash
# Generate a fresh base64-encoded 32-byte key.
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Export it:

```bash
export SPRING_SECRETS_AES_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

Or write it to a mounted file:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32 > /secrets/spring-aes.key
# ...and set Secrets:AesKeyFile=/secrets/spring-aes.key in config.
```

### Rotation

**Per-secret rotation** is supported via `PUT /api/v1/units/{id}/secrets/{name}` (and the tenant / platform mirrors). The endpoint atomically:

1. Writes the replacement value via `ISecretStore.WriteAsync` (pass-through) or records the new pointer (external reference).
2. Updates the registry row's `StoreKey`, `Origin`, `Version` (incremented), and `UpdatedAt`.
3. Immediately deletes the old backing slot — **only** for platform-owned entries. External-reference rotations never touch the customer-owned slot.

The registry-level primitive is `ISecretRegistry.RotateAsync`, which returns a `SecretRotation` summary (from/to versions, pointer transition, whether the old slot was reclaimed). Audit-log decorators wrapping the registry consume this to emit rotation events without any private state — see [`secret-audit.md`](secret-audit.md).

**Delete policy.** The OSS core applies an immediate-delete policy: once the registry points at the new key, no in-flight reader can reach the old slot, so any retention window would only leak plaintext. Callers that already hold the old plaintext in memory are unaffected.

**Multi-version coexistence** (caller pinning to `v1` while the server is on `v2`) is tracked as a follow-up to #201 — the current wave intentionally supports only a single live version per `(tenant, scope, owner, name)` triple.

**Key-material rotation** (the AES-GCM envelope key itself) is still operator-driven:

1. Stand up a new environment with the new key.
2. Export secrets from the old environment (via the API, which emits plaintext once the caller passes authorization), re-import into the new one.
3. Retire the old key.

Production deployments that need transparent key rotation should externalize key material via the private cloud `ISecretStore` implementation (Azure Key Vault / AWS KMS), which supports native rotation policies.

## Per-Tenant Dapr Component Isolation

By default the OSS store uses a single Dapr component (`Secrets:StoreComponent`, defaulting to `statestore`) for every tenant. Structural tenant isolation comes from the registry; the shared component is a dev convenience.

Set `Secrets:ComponentNameFormat` to a template containing `{tenantId}` to switch to per-tenant components:

```json
{
  "Secrets": {
    "ComponentNameFormat": "statestore-{tenantId}"
  }
}
```

With this setting, a call from tenant `acme` reads and writes via the Dapr component named `statestore-acme`. Operators are responsible for provisioning those components (see [Dapr's multi-component guide](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/components/component-scopes/)). A misconfigured caller that targets the wrong component sees nothing — this is defence in depth on top of the registry's tenant filter.

### Legacy Key Fallback

The canonical backend key is `Secrets:KeyPrefix + storeKey` (no tenant segment). An earlier shape embedded the tenant — `secrets/{tenantId}/{storeKey}` — and the store still tries that form if the canonical read misses. This keeps data readable immediately after flipping `ComponentNameFormat` on; writes migrate the row to the canonical key naturally, and `DeleteAsync` best-effort cleans up both shapes.

A one-time rewrite is only needed if operators want to reclaim storage eagerly; the resolver tolerates the mixed state.

## Anthropic credentials: per-path routing (#1690)

The `anthropic-api-key` slot accepts two credential shapes. Both are first-class; the platform routes each shape to the dispatch paths it can actually authenticate.

| Stored value | `IAgentRuntime` (in-container `claude` CLI) | `IAgentRuntime` validation probe (`claude --bare`) | `IAiProvider` (`AnthropicProvider` REST) | BYOI agents calling Anthropic REST directly |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sk-ant-api-…` (Platform API key) | Routed as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Routed as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Accepted | Accepted (when the agent image reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` itself) |
| `sk-ant-oat-…` (Claude.ai OAuth token) | Routed as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Probe drops `--bare` so the CLI's standard auth path picks it up | Rejected pre-flight by `ClaudeAgentRuntime.IsCredentialFormatAccepted` | Rejected — REST does not honour OAuth tokens |
| Neither | Rejected pre-flight | Rejected pre-flight | Rejected pre-flight | Rejected pre-flight |

**Where the routing lives:**

- **Format check (pre-flight):** `ClaudeAgentRuntime.IsCredentialFormatAccepted(string credential, CredentialDispatchPath dispatchPath)` — implemented in `src/Cvoya.Spring.AgentRuntimes.Claude/ClaudeAgentRuntime.cs`. Returns `false` for OAuth on `Rest`, `false` for neither-shape on every path. Empty values pass-through (the resolver's `NotConfigured` state owns "no credential").
- **Env-var routing (in-container probes):** `ClaudeAgentRuntime.GetProbeSteps` switches on the OAuth prefix to set either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and to drop `--bare` for OAuth (so the CLI's standard auth path picks the token up).
- **REST guard:** `AnthropicProvider.RejectOAuthToken` in `src/Cvoya.Spring.Dapr/Execution/AnthropicProvider.cs` fails-fast on OAuth tokens at REST-call time — keeps the 401 from looking like an "expired key" in the activity log.
- **Status endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/platform/credentials/anthropic/status` reports both the scalar resolvability for the path the caller asked about (`?dispatchPath=`) and a `paths` matrix that names each path's verdict (`summary`: `all-paths` / `in-container-cli-only` / `format-rejected`).

**Adding a runtime that accepts a new shape.** Implement `IAgentRuntime.IsCredentialFormatAccepted` to encode the per-path acceptance rules. The status endpoint reads the matrix automatically — adding a new dispatch path to `CredentialDispatchPath` flows through to the response without endpoint changes; adding a new `summary` label requires extending the switch in `SystemEndpoints.BuildPathResolvability`.

> **`agent: spring-voyage, provider: anthropic` is not yet wired in OSS.** The Dapr-Agent runtime (`spring-voyage` tool) talks to the LLM through Dapr Conversation components. The OSS deployment ships only `conversation-ollama.yaml` (the tenant-network Ollama instance); there is no `conversation-anthropic.yaml`, and the `DaprAgentLauncher` does not propagate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` into the container today. An operator who configures `agent: spring-voyage, provider: anthropic` will see the unit deploy, but the agentic loop's first `DaprChatClient.generate` call will fail because the `llm-provider` Dapr component has no Anthropic backend wired. Tracked in #1714 — covers the per-provider Conversation-component work and `DaprAgentLauncher` env-injection.

## Recommended Defaults

| Environment   | `SPRING_SECRETS_AES_KEY` | `ComponentNameFormat` |
|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Local dev     | generated once per workstation, kept in `deployment/spring.env` | unset (shared) |
| CI            | generated per run, set in the pipeline env | unset |
| Staging/Prod  | sourced from vault / mounted secret file | `"statestore-{tenantId}"` when running multi-tenant |

Production deployments should not rely on this at-rest layer as their primary protection — use the KMS-backed store implementation provided by the cloud host. The envelope layer is a belt-and-braces guard against backup leaks and operator errors.
