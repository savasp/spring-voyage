# Open Questions

## Resolved

1. ~~**GitHub Connector**~~ — **Resolved: Rewrite in C#** for consistency with the .NET infrastructure layer. The Python v1 connector will not be carried forward.
2. ~~**Second Connector**~~ — **Resolved: should serve the product-management domain** (Phase 3). Linear, Notion, or Jira — whichever best fits the product management workflow.
3. ~~**Active Conversation Model**~~ — **Resolved: all agents use one-active-with-suspension.** Hosted agents have brief active periods; delegated agents have longer ones. Uniform model, with performance optimizations possible later. See [Messaging](messaging.md).
4. ~~**Prompt Assembly: Conversation Context**~~ — **Resolved: four-layer prompt model.** Conversation context (prior messages, checkpoints, partial results) is Layer 3, injected per invocation. See [Units & Agents](units.md).

## Remaining

1. **Web UI Technology** — Recommendation: React/Next.js + TypeScript. The testing ecosystem (React Testing Library, Vitest, Playwright, MSW, Storybook) is the most mature in frontend. TypeScript provides type safety. The gap with the .NET backend is bridgeable via OpenAPI codegen. Blazor stays in the .NET ecosystem and shares types, but has a smaller component library and testing ecosystem. Final decision pending evaluation.
2. **Tier 1 LLM Hosting** — In-process (ONNX/llama.cpp) vs. separate container (Ollama). See [Initiative](initiative.md).
3. **Testing Strategy** — Integration tests with Dapr sidecar in CI.
4. **State Schema Evolution** — Versioned serialization for actor state changes. See [Security](security.md) (Platform Versioning & Migrations).
5. **Rx.NET Version** — Pin to 6.x or track latest. See [Observability](observability.md).
6. **A2A Protocol Version** — Which version to target; maturity assessment. See [Workflows](workflows.md).
7. **Dapr Agents vs. Custom Python Loop** — Needs prototyping to evaluate fit. See [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md).
8. **Streaming Hot Path** — Through actor (consistent) vs. direct to API host (fast). The dual-subscriber model (actor + API host both subscribe to the same Dapr pub/sub topic) is a candidate but needs validation. See [Messaging](messaging.md).
9. **Initiative Policy Granularity** — Is `max_level` sufficient (each level implies capabilities), or should there be explicit per-capability flags? See [Initiative](initiative.md).
10. **Event Stream Separation** — Whether to split `ActivityEvent` into a high-frequency execution stream and a lower-frequency activity summary stream. See [Observability](observability.md).

## Future Work

The following capabilities are beyond the phased implementation but the architecture is designed to accommodate them. Interfaces and extension points are in place.

### Alwyse: Cognitive Backbone

Alwyse is an optional **observer agent** that acts as each Spring Voyage agent's personal intelligence. When enabled, it replaces default implementations with cognitive equivalents:

```mermaid
graph LR
    ada["Ada (SV Agent)<br/>receives work · writes code · creates PRs"]
    alwyse["Ada's Alwyse (Observer)<br/>accumulates experience<br/>builds expertise · adapts prompts"]
    ada -- "activity stream" --> alwyse
    alwyse -- "cognitive feedback" --> ada
    alwyse -- "sub-agent services" --> ada
```



**Integration points (designed now, implemented later):**

1. `IMemoryStore` — `AlwyseMemoryStore` replaces PostgreSQL key-value with cognitive memory
2. `ICognitionProvider` — `AlwyseCognitionProvider` powers the initiative reflect/decide steps
3. `IExpertiseTracker` — `AlwyseExpertiseTracker` evolves profiles from observed outcomes
4. `ActivityStream` observer — implicit permission to observe the agent

**Without Alwyse:** default implementations (PostgreSQL memory, LLM-based cognition, static expertise). System is fully functional.

**With Alwyse:** cognitive memory, pattern recognition, expertise evolution, sub-agent spawning. Premium enhancement.

### Future Directions

**Expertise Marketplace**

Cross-unit expertise access with cost structures — token-based billing, expertise licensing, usage metering, SLA contracts. The directory and routing infrastructure supports this. A unit could "hire" an expert from another unit for a specific task, with metered billing and SLA guarantees.

**Dynamic Agent & Unit Creation**

Agents and units created programmatically at runtime to meet emerging needs:

- **Workload scaling** — a unit spawns additional agents when its work queue grows, decommissions when idle.
- **Specialist spawning** — an agent encountering an unfamiliar domain requests creation of a specialist agent.
- **Ad-hoc units** — agents self-organize into temporary units for complex multi-agent tasks, then dissolve.
- **Emergent structure** — the unit hierarchy evolves at runtime, not just at configuration time.

Requires the `agent.spawn` permission and respects initiative budgets/policies.

**Cross-Organization Federation**

Multiple Spring Voyage deployments (different companies/teams) federating expertise directories. Requires trust, authentication, and billing across organizational boundaries.

**Advanced Self-Organization**

Agents negotiating task allocation, forming ad-hoc sub-units for complex tasks, and reorganizing unit structure based on workload patterns. With initiative and recursive composition, a unit could restructure itself — splitting into sub-units when tasks become complex, merging back when work is done.

**Alwyse Depth**

As Alwyse matures: agents that develop genuine specialization, transfer knowledge between contexts, mentor junior agents, and build institutional memory that transcends individual agents. Initiative becomes increasingly sophisticated — agents that anticipate problems before they occur, that proactively improve the systems they work on, that develop professional relationships with humans and other agents.

**Unit Evolution**

Units that evolve their own structure over time — adding new roles, adjusting policies, refining workflows based on outcomes. The unit's AI (powered by Alwyse) learns what compositions work best for different types of work.
