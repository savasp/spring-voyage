## 1. Context & Problem Statement

### What v1 Taught Us

Spring Voyage v1 is a working proof-of-concept: Claude-powered agents collaborating on GitHub repositories. It works — but its architecture has fundamental limitations that prevent it from becoming the general-purpose AI team platform it needs to be.

**v1 limitations driving v2:**

1. **GitHub-centric by design.** The entire model — issues as work items, labels as state, PRs as output, webhooks as events — is hardwired to software engineering on GitHub. A product management team working with documents, a creative team working with Figma, a people management team working with messages — none of these fit v1's model.
2. **Flat team structure only.** v1 has one organizational unit: a team of expert agents with a team leader. No nested teams, no communities, no ad-hoc gatherings, no self-organizing groups.
3. **Single-human interaction model.** v1 assumes one user. Multiple humans interacting with the same agent or team — with different permission levels — isn't supported.
4. **Brittle, baked-in state machine.** The v1 state machine (READY → IN_PROGRESS → DONE with label-based transitions) is fragile and hardcoded. Different work patterns need different workflows — from explicit step-by-step orchestration to fully LLM-driven coordination.
5. **Poor observability.** Observing agent work and errors requires admin platform access and log diving. No structured activity streams, no agent-to-agent observation, no dashboard-level insight into what agents are thinking and deciding.
6. **Multi-tenancy as afterthought.** No clean tenant upgrades, no tenant-scoped access control, single-user assumption throughout.
7. **Human-in-the-loop only.** v1 agents wait for assignments, do work, wait for review. No initiative, no continuous operation, no autonomous decision-making.
8. **Python runtime issues.** Despite thousands of tests, many errors surface only at runtime. Type safety at the infrastructure/plumbing layer would reduce this class of bugs.
9. **Manual concurrency scaling.** To handle concurrent work of the same type, v1 required defining multiple identical agents (e.g., three backend engineers). If all were busy, work queued. No dynamic scaling, no elasticity.

### What v1 Got Right (and we carry forward)

- The core insight: AI agents collaborating through external tools (Claude Code) with worktree isolation
- Brain/Hands separation (implicit in v1, explicit in v2)
- The general flow: receive work → plan → execute → deliver → learn
- Agent memory (persistent learning across conversations)
- Prompt assembly patterns
- Web dashboard concept (activity feed, agent status, analytics)

## 2. Vision & Goals

Spring Voyage V2 is a general-purpose AI agent orchestration platform. It enables autonomous AI agents — organized into composable groups called **units** — to collaborate on any domain: software engineering, product management, creative work, research, operations, and more.

Agents connect to external systems through pluggable **connectors**, communicate via typed **messages**, take **initiative** to act autonomously, and can be observed by humans and other agents in real-time.

### Design Goals

Each goal directly addresses a v1 limitation:


| Goal                                                                                               | Addresses                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Domain-agnostic.** Agents work with any external system, not just GitHub.                        | v1 limitation #1 (GitHub-centric)         |
| **Composable.** Units nest recursively. A unit appears as a single agent to its parent.            | v1 limitation #2 (flat teams)             |
| **Multi-human.** Multiple humans interact with agents at different permission levels.              | v1 limitation #3 (single-human)           |
| **Flexible orchestration.** From rigid workflows to fully autonomous — each unit chooses.          | v1 limitation #4 (brittle state machine)  |
| **Observable.** Humans see what agents are doing, thinking, deciding, and spending — in real-time. | v1 limitation #5 (poor observability)     |
| **Extensible for multi-tenancy.** Designed for clean isolation and scoped access via extensions.   | v1 limitation #6 (afterthought)           |
| **Self-organizing.** Agents take initiative, operate continuously, and make autonomous decisions.  | v1 limitation #7 (human-in-the-loop only) |
| **Type-safe infrastructure.** .NET infrastructure layer with Dapr building blocks.                 | v1 limitation #8 (Python runtime issues)  |
| **Elastic.** Agents clone dynamically to handle concurrent work. No manual agent duplication.      | v1 limitation #9 (manual scaling)         |
| **Cost-aware.** Every LLM call, every initiative reflection, every action has a tracked cost.      | New requirement                           |

## 3. Terminology


| Term                      | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**                 | An autonomous AI-powered entity. Not necessarily a "worker" — can be an observer, advisor, monitor, researcher.              |
| **Unit**                  | A group of agents performing together. A unit IS an agent (composite pattern). Contains agents and/or other units.           |
| **Connector**             | A pluggable adapter bridging an external system (GitHub, Slack, Figma, etc.) to the unit.                                    |
| **Message**               | A typed communication between addressable entities.                                                                          |
| **Address**               | A globally-unique routable identity (namespaced by tenant + unit path).                                                      |
| **Topic**                 | A named pub/sub channel for event distribution.                                                                              |
| **Package**               | An installable bundle of skills, connectors, workflows, templates, or config.                                                |
| **Activation**            | What causes an agent to wake up and act.                                                                                     |
| **Workflow**              | A durable, structured execution plan for a unit.                                                                             |
| **Directory**             | A registry of agent expertise, queryable within and across units.                                                            |
| **Mailbox**               | An agent's inbound message system with prioritized channels.                                                                 |
| **Initiative**            | An agent's capacity to autonomously decide to act without external triggers.                                                 |
