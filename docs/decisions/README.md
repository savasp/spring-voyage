# Decision Records

Short, dated records of decisions that lock in a specific trade-off — kept alongside the code so the reasoning survives contributor churn. The lower-numbered records (0001–0014) capture narrow per-feature trade-offs that arrived alongside specific PRs / issues; the 0015+ block captures the foundational platform-stack decisions that frame everything else.

Use these when:

- A decision affects more than one subsystem and needs to be discoverable from either side.
- The reasoning ("why not the obvious alternative?") will otherwise be forgotten.
- The decision is deferred pending an ecosystem signal — the record captures the trigger conditions.

For open design questions that have **not** yet been decided, see [`../architecture/open-questions.md`](../architecture/open-questions.md).

## Format

Each record has the following sections: **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**, and (when the decision is time-bound) **Revisit criteria**. Keep the file to roughly one page — if it grows longer, the extra detail belongs in an architecture doc that the record links to.
