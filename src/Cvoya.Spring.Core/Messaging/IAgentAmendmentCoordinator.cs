/// <summary>
/// Seam that encapsulates the mid-flight amendment concern extracted from
/// <c>AgentActor</c>: parsing the amendment payload, authorising the sender,

/// <see cref="AmendmentPriority.StopAndWait"/> semantics, and emitting the
/// corresponding <see cref="ActivityEvent"/>s.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The interface lives in <c>Cvoya.Spring.Core</c> so the cloud host can
/// substitute a tenant-aware coordinator (e.g. one that layers audit logging
/// on every amendment, enforces per-tenant rate limits, or gates amendments on
/// a permission model) without touching the actor. Per the platform's
/// "interface-first + TryAdd*" rule, production DI registers the default
/// implementation with <c>TryAddSingleton</c> so the private repo's
/// registration takes precedence when present.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The coordinator holds zero Dapr-actor references. <see cref="HandleAmendmentAsync"/>
/// receives delegate parameters so the actor can inject its own state-read,
/// state-write, cancellation, and activity-emission implementations without
/// the coordinator depending on Dapr actor types or scoped DI services.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Both <c>IUnitMembershipRepository</c> (used for sender authorisation) and
/// the active-work-cancellation source are scoped / per-actor — they are
/// passed as delegates so the coordinator can remain a singleton and share
/// safely across all <c>AgentActor</c> instances.
