/// <summary>
/// Seam that encapsulates the unit-policy enforcement concern extracted from
/// <c>AgentActor</c>: evaluating model caps (#247), cost caps (#248), and

/// returning either a (possibly coerced) <see cref="AgentMetadata"/> or a
/// <see cref="PolicyVerdict"/> that causes the dispatch to be refused.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The interface lives in <c>Cvoya.Spring.Core</c> so the cloud host can
/// substitute a tenant-aware coordinator (e.g. one that layers audit logging
/// on every enforcement decision, or adds additional policy dimensions) without
/// touching the actor. Per the platform's "interface-first + TryAdd*" rule,
/// production DI registers the default implementation with
/// <c>TryAddSingleton</c> so the private repo's registration takes precedence
/// when present.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The coordinator holds zero Dapr-actor references. <see cref="ApplyUnitPoliciesAsync"/>
/// receives delegate parameters so the actor can inject its own
/// policy-evaluation implementations without the coordinator depending on Dapr
/// actor types or scoped DI services.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>IUnitPolicyEnforcer</c> is scoped — it is passed as a set of per-call
/// delegates (<paramref name="evaluateModel"/>, <paramref name="evaluateCost"/>,
/// <paramref name="resolveExecutionMode"/>) rather than injected on the
/// coordinator constructor. This matches the pattern established by
/// <see cref="IAgentObservationCoordinator.RunInitiativeCheckAsync"/>'s
/// <c>evaluateSkillPolicy</c> delegate, and prevents the singleton coordinator
/// from capturing a scoped service (which would trip
/// <c>WorkerCompositionTests.AddWorkerServices_BuildsProviderWithoutMissingRegistrations</c>
/// with <c>ValidateScopes = true</c>).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The coordinator is stateless with respect to any individual agent — it
/// operates entirely through the per-call delegates. This makes it safe to
/// register as a singleton and share across all <c>AgentActor</c> instances.
