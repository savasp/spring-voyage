/// <c>Cvoya.Spring.Dapr</c> package resolves the unit's execution defaults
/// (image, runtime, credential, model), schedules the workflow via
/// <c>DaprWorkflowClient</c>, and returns the instance id so the actor can

/// The interface lives in <c>Cvoya.Spring.Core</c> so the cloud host can
/// substitute a tenant-aware scheduler (e.g. one that dispatches the
/// workflow to a tenant-scoped Dapr app id) without touching the actor.
/// Per the platform's "interface-first + TryAdd*" rule, production DI
/// registers the Dapr-backed scheduler with <c>TryAddSingleton</c> so the
/// private repo's registration takes precedence when present.

/// Returning the unit's name alongside the workflow instance id lets the
/// actor's stale-run guard compare against

/// the workflow emit <c>ValidationProgress</c> events scoped to the unit's
/// name so the web detail page's SSE filter (which keys on the unit's
