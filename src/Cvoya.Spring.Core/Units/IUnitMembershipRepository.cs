/// per-membership config overrides. An agent may have any number of
/// memberships — unit-typed members remain 1:N per #217, but the
/// <c>(unit, agent)</c> relation is M:N at the storage level.

/// taking a dependency on <c>Cvoya.Spring.Dapr</c>. The default
/// implementation lives in <c>Cvoya.Spring.Dapr.Data</c> and uses
