/// The interface lives in <c>Cvoya.Spring.Core</c> so the cloud host can
/// substitute a tenant-aware coordinator (e.g. one that layers audit logging
/// on every seeding event or gates seeding on per-tenant flags) without
/// touching the actor. Per the platform's "interface-first + TryAdd*" rule,
/// production DI registers the default implementation with
/// <c>TryAddSingleton</c> so the private repo's registration takes precedence
/// when present.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The coordinator does not hold a reference to the actor. Instead,
/// <see cref="ActivateAsync"/> receives delegate parameters so the actor can
/// inject its own state-read, state-write, and seed-fetch implementations
/// without the coordinator depending on Dapr actor types or scoped DI
/// services.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The coordinator is stateless with respect to any individual agent — it
/// operates entirely through the per-call delegates and the injected
/// singleton seams. This makes it safe to register as a singleton and share
