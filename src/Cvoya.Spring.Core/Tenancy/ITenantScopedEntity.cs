/// Marker contract implemented by every business-data entity that must

/// <c>HasQueryFilter(e =&gt; e.TenantId == tenantContext.CurrentTenantId
/// &amp;&amp; e.DeletedAt == null)</c> on the corresponding
/// <c>IEntityTypeConfiguration</c>. The filter is enforced
/// platform-wide so ad-hoc <c>DbSet</c> queries cannot accidentally
/// leak rows across tenants.

/// <para>
/// System / ops tables (migrations history, startup configuration) do
/// <b>not</b> implement this interface — they are intentionally global
/// and remain outside the tenant query filter. When in doubt: a row
/// that a customer could observe or mutate is business-data and must
/// be tenant-scoped.

/// When a new business-data entity is introduced, the implementer must
/// (a) implement this interface, (b) set <see cref="TenantId"/> on
/// insert paths to the current <c>ITenantContext.CurrentTenantId</c>,

/// filter in the entity's configuration. See
