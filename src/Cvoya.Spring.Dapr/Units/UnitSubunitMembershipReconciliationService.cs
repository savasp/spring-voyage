/// <summary>
/// Hosted service that reconciles the persistent
/// <c>unit_subunit_memberships</c> projection with the authoritative
/// <c>unit://</c>-scheme entries kept in <c>UnitActor</c> state on host
/// startup (#1154). Lets the projection survive process restarts on
/// existing deployments where the column did not exist before this
/// migration, and recovers from any drift caused by an actor
/// write-through that failed mid-call.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Single-owner invariant.</strong> Mirrors
/// <see cref="Cvoya.Spring.Dapr.Data.DatabaseMigrator"/> /
/// <see cref="Tenancy.DefaultTenantBootstrapService"/>: registered
/// exactly once per deployment from the host that owns the actor
/// runtime (the Worker in OSS topology). Multiple replicas of the
/// same host will run the reconciliation concurrently — every write
/// goes through <see cref="IUnitSubunitMembershipProjector"/> so the
/// upserts are idempotent and races collapse on PK; running it more
/// than once does not corrupt the projection but does pay extra
/// per-actor round-trips.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Best-effort.</strong> A directory service that has no
/// units, an actor that fails to respond, or a database that rejects
/// the upsert all log + continue. The startup path must never block
/// on a transient projection failure — the actor-state list remains
/// the runtime source of truth and the worker can serve traffic with
/// a stale tree until the next reconciliation pass.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Runs after <c>ApplicationStarted</c>.</strong> The
/// reconciliation issues outbound <see cref="IUnitActor"/> proxy
/// calls. Those calls travel through the Dapr sidecar, which has to
/// call back into the worker on its app port to activate / route to
/// the actor — so the worker must be listening before we issue them.
/// <see cref="IHostedService.StartAsync"/> runs <em>before</em>
/// Kestrel binds, which is why this service derives from
/// <see cref="BackgroundService"/> and gates the reconciliation on
/// <see cref="IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStarted"/>: a
/// previous incarnation that ran the reconciliation directly inside
/// <c>StartAsync</c> deadlocked on the sidecar callback for 100&#8239;s,
/// timed out with <see cref="TaskCanceledException"/> (which the old
/// "ex is not <see cref="OperationCanceledException"/>" filter let
/// escape), and crashed the worker into a restart loop that prevented
/// every actor — <see cref="AgentActor"/> included — from ever
/// registering with Dapr placement. See the
/// <c>did not find address for actor 'AgentActor/&lt;guid&gt;'</c>
/// regression after the #1155 deployment.
