/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The scan is O(units) today. For the current data volume — units are tens
/// to hundreds per deployment and the permission walk is a request-time
/// check that happens at most once per authorized endpoint call — that's
/// acceptable. When the directory grows a reverse-membership index this
/// resolver can be swapped out via DI without touching

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Failures to read member lists from individual unit actors (e.g. actor
/// unavailable) are logged and treated as "this unit is not a parent of the
/// child" — a permission check must never fail closed because one sibling
/// unit is down. Directory failures stop the walk and return the caller an
/// empty list, so the permission service degrades to "no inheritance"
/// rather than incorrectly promoting a human to admin.
