// that path in favour of the per-runtime `POST /api/v1/agent-runtimes/{id}/validate-credential`
// route. The status probe (GET /status) remains because the agent/unit
// Execution panels depend on the tenant-default resolvability signal it

/// Platform-system-status endpoints. Today this group exposes a
