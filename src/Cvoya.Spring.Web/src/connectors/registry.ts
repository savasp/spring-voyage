// Central slug -> React component registry. Extension seam: when a new
// connector lands, add a new entry here pointing at the component(s) under
// that connector package's `web/` subdirectory (see
// `src/Cvoya.Spring.Connector.GitHub/web/` for the canonical shape).
//
// Each connector package owns its own web directory; the web project
// references it through a `@connector-<slug>/*` tsconfig path alias
// (see `tsconfig.json`) and Turbopack resolves cross-directory
// `node_modules` imports via `turbopack.root` in `next.config.ts`.
//
// Today's implementation is statically-imported: the registry knows each
// component at build time. Hot-loading / dynamic imports are deliberately
// out of scope until a second connector lands (see #195 for the runtime
// discovery follow-up).
//
// Each connector can ship up to two entry points:
//
//   * `connector-tab.tsx` (required) — rendered inside the Connector tab
//     of an already-bound unit. Operates against a live unit id.
//   * `connector-wizard-step.tsx` (optional, #199) — rendered inside
//     Step 3 of the create-unit wizard. Runs *before* the unit exists,
//     so it has no unit id and bubbles config up to the wizard, which
//     bundles it into the single transactional create-unit call.
//
// Consistency between the .NET connector slug, the registry entry, and
// the web submodule on disk is enforced in CI by
// `scripts/validate-connector-web.sh`.
