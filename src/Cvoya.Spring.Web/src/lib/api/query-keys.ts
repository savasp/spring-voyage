/**
 * Query-key factory for the portal's TanStack Query cache.
 *
 * Every `useQuery`/`useMutation` in the web project should build its
 * key through one of these functions so the activity-stream hook and
 * `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.<surface>.all })`
 * can find the right slices to patch/invalidate. Keys are shaped as
 * tuples: the first element is the surface, further elements narrow
 * the slice.
 *
 * Convention:
 *   - `all` — the whole surface (invalidate everything on that feature)
 *   - `detail(id)` — one entity by id
 *   - `list(params?)` — the indexed list, optionally with params
