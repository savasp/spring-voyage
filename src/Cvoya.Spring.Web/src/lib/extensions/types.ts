// Type contracts for the portal extension system (#440).
//
// The OSS portal must stay tenancy-unaware. The private Spring Voyage
// Cloud repo extends it via DI-style registration (`registerExtension`)
// to add tenant switcher, billing, members, and audit surfaces. The
// contracts below are the seams the hosted build plugs into.

/**
 * Logical sidebar section that a route belongs to. Keeps the sidebar
 * free of hard-coded groupings — hosted-only entries (e.g. "Tenant",
 * "Billing") can pick the "settings" section without patching OSS.
 *
 * New sections are added by appending to this union. The sidebar
 * renders sections in the order declared by `NAV_SECTION_ORDER` below.
 */

/**
 * A single navigable route exposed by the portal. Both the sidebar
 * and the command palette consume the manifest — the same type
 * therefore has to satisfy both surfaces.
 *
 * - `path`        — Next.js App Router path (`/units`, `/units/[id]`).
 *                   Dynamic routes are allowed but the sidebar/palette
 *                   only link to concrete paths (no param substitution
 *                   at this layer — extensions surface concrete routes).
 * - `label`       — short human-readable name used as the nav label
 *                   and the primary palette entry title.
 * - `icon`        — React component rendered at 16×16 in the sidebar
 *                   and 14×14 in the palette. Kept as a generic
 *                   component type so extensions aren't forced to use
 *                   `lucide-react`.
 * - `navSection`  — which sidebar group the route belongs to.
 * - `permission`  — optional capability key. When set, the route is
 *                   only rendered if the current auth context reports
 *                   it via `hasPermission(key)`. OSS's default auth
 *                   adapter grants all permissions, so OSS-only
 *                   entries omit this field entirely.
 * - `orderHint`   — optional sort key within a section. Lower numbers
 *                   render first. Entries without `orderHint` sort
 *                   after ordered entries, in registration order.
 * - `keywords`    — optional extra terms the palette uses for fuzzy
 *                   matching ("costs" → palette also matches
 *                   "spending", "budget").
 * - `description` — optional one-liner shown beneath the label in the
 *                   palette. Not rendered in the sidebar.
