#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Validates the connector-web wiring across the monorepo.
#
# Each connector under src/Cvoya.Spring.Connector.<Name>/ may optionally
# ship a web/ submodule holding its React/TypeScript UI (consumed by
# src/Cvoya.Spring.Web via the @connector-<slug>/* tsconfig alias and
# registered in src/Cvoya.Spring.Web/src/connectors/registry.ts). This
# script enforces the following invariants in CI:
#
#   1. Every connector package that has a web/ subdirectory declares the
#      expected tab entry file (`connector-tab.tsx`) and a package.json
#      workspace manifest (so the npm workspace root can hoist its deps).
#   2. The tab file exports a React component named `<PascalCase>ConnectorTab`
#      derived from the package name (drift guard between the .NET slug
#      and the component identifier).
#   3. If a connector also ships a wizard-step file
#      (`connector-wizard-step.tsx`, optional — see #199), it must export
#      `<PascalCase>ConnectorWizardStep`. A connector without this file
#      is fine; the wizard falls back to a "configure after creation"
#      hint for that connector.
#   4. Every connector slug referenced from the Web registry has a
#      matching on-disk submodule under the expected connector package.
#   5. Every connector package with a web/ subdirectory has a registry
#      entry (no orphaned submodules that ship code the web app cannot
#      discover).
#
# Patterned after the "Validate agent definition references" step in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml — simple pure-bash checks, zero runtime
# dependencies, deliberately strict on layout.
#
# Exit 0 => all connectors validated (or none exist yet).
# Exit 1 => at least one invariant violated; messages are formatted as
#   GitHub workflow annotations (::error::) so CI surfaces them inline.
